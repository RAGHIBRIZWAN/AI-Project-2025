## 1. Overview

### This project is about creating an interactive digital map that shows all shopping places in Karachi. 

### i) Shopping Malls: We will show only the name and location. 
### ii) Traditional Markets (Bazaars): We will go deeper and show major markets like Zainab Market, Tariq Road, etc. 

### We will use the A* (A-Star) algorithm to help users find the best path 
from one shop to another inside these busy markets. 
2. Objectives 
1. Map of All Shopping Areas in Karachi: 
o Add all shopping malls with names and locations. 
o Add traditional markets with detail. 
2. Pathfinding with A* Algorithm: 
o Help users find the shortest and easiest way to reach a shop. 
o Show alternative routes based on user preference (e.g., 
shortest, less crowded). 
3. Easy-to-Use Interface: 
o Simple visual map where users can zoom in. 
o Filters to find shops by category (clothes, electronics, food, 
etc.) 
4. Algorithm: A* (used for calculating shortest paths) 
5. How It Will Work (Method) 
1. Gather Data: 
o List all shopping malls in Karachi with their names and 
locations. 
o Visit or research top 10 traditional bazaars and collect data 
2. Create a Market Map: 
o Draw markets like a grid or map. 
o Each area will be a point (node), and paths between them will 
be lines (edges). 
3. Use A* Algorithm: 
o A* will find the shortest or fastest way between two shops. 
o It uses distance and direction to calculate the best path. 
4. Build the Application: 
o Show the map on the screen. 
o Allow users to get directions using A*. 
o Search bar to find shops by name or type. 
5. Expected Results 
 A complete digital map of all shopping malls and major markets 
in Karachi. 
 A working A* algorithm that gives the shortest path to any market 
or shopping mall. 
 A clean, easy-to-use interface for navigation. 
6. Why This Project is Useful 
 Helps locals and tourists easily find shops in crowded markets. 
 Saves time and effort by showing the best path. 
 Promotes digital transformation of traditional shopping areas. 
 Good practice for AI concepts like pathfinding and graph 
theory. 
7. Conclusion 
This project will create a smart shopping guide for Karachi. It will 
make it easier for people to find and reach shops in big and busy 
markets. With the help of the A* algorithm, we will provide the best 
shopping routes. The project is a great combination of real-life use and 
AI technology.
